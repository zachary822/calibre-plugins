# CrossPoint Reader Calibre Plugin

This plugin adds CrossPoint Reader as a wireless device in Calibre. It uploads
EPUB files over WebSocket to the CrossPoint web server.

Protocol:
- Connect to ws://<host>:<port>/
- Send: START:<filename>:<size>:<path>
- Wait for READY
- Send binary frames with file content
- Wait for DONE (or ERROR:<message>)

Default settings:
- Auto-discover device via UDP
- Host fallback: 192.168.4.1
- Port: 81
- Upload path: /
- Upload template: blank, which uses Calibre's send-to-device template
- Upload reliability: 3 retries, 2s retry delay, 1s delay between books,
  30s socket timeout

## Optimizer

The plugin can optimize EPUBs before transfer, mirroring the optimizer built into
the CrossPoint web server. The optimizer is based on the initial work by
[@zgredex](https://github.com/zgredex), ported here from the firmware. When
enabled (Preferences > Plugins > device config >
"Optimize EPUBs before transfer"), each EPUB is processed before upload:

- Every image is scaled to fit the device screen, converted to grayscale, and
  re-encoded as JPEG (quality configurable, default 85). Optional auto-crop trims
  uniform page margins.
- The container is rewritten: raster images are renamed to `.jpg`, stale `<img>`
  width/height are stripped, SVG covers/wrapped images are unwrapped, OPF
  media-types and cover meta are fixed, the NCX identifier is synced, a small
  defensive stylesheet is injected, and the archive is re-zipped mimetype-first.
- Text is restructured for the firmware's layout memory limits (optional,
  "Split large chapters/paragraphs" checkbox, on by default): paragraphs larger
  than ~1.6 KB are split into ~1.2 KB `<p>` siblings at sentence boundaries
  (the firmware lays out a whole paragraph at once, holding every word in RAM,
  so a single multi-KB paragraph can OOM the device even in a small file);
  spine files larger than ~9.5 KB are split into ~7 KB files with the OPF
  manifest/spine expanded and `href="...#fragment"` links remapped onto the
  chunk holding the anchor; embedded fonts and `@font-face` rules are removed;
  page-list navs are dropped; and base64 `data:` URI images are extracted into
  real (optimized) image files. Every text transformation verifies that the
  visible text is byte-identical and reverts itself on any mismatch or error.

The target screen size comes from the device profile — **X4 = 480×800**,
**X3 = 528×792** — which is auto-detected from the device's `/api/status`
endpoint on connect (matching the web UI), or can be set manually
(Auto / X4 / X3) in the plugin settings.

Optimization runs as part of Calibre's existing device-transfer job, without
opening another window. The Jobs entry shows live optimization/upload status;
open that entry's details to see every optimization step (per book: each
image's before→after size, fixes, and upload) followed by the combined totals.
When several books are sent at once they are processed in turn in the same job.
If optimization fails for a book, the original is sent unchanged so a transfer
is never blocked.

### Using the optimizer

1. Open **Preferences → Plugins**, expand **Device Interface plugins**, select
   **CrossPoint Reader**, and click **Customize plugin**.
2. Check **Optimize EPUBs before transfer**.
3. Set the options below it (they enable once the box is checked):
   - **Device target** — leave on **Auto-detect** to read X3/X4 from the device
     on connect, or force **X4** / **X3**. Auto-detect falls back to X4 if the
     device can't be queried.
   - **JPEG quality** — 1–100 (default 85). Lower = smaller files.
   - **Convert images to grayscale** — on by default (recommended for e-ink).
   - **Auto-crop uniform margins** — off by default; trims solid page borders.
   - **Split large chapters/paragraphs, remove fonts (prevents out-of-memory)**
     — on by default; restructures text for the firmware's layout memory limits
     (see above). Disable it to keep the EPUB's file/paragraph structure as-is.
4. Click **OK**, then **restart Calibre** if it was already running so the new
   settings take effect.
5. Send a book to the device as usual (right-click → *Send to device*, or the
   **Send to device** toolbar button). The EPUB is optimized just before upload.
6. As the transfer runs, use Calibre's **Jobs** indicator to follow its status.
   Click the transfer job and open **Show job details** to see each optimizer
   step — per book, the images processed/cropped and fixes applied — followed by
   the combined totals. Selecting multiple books processes them one after
   another in the same job. The same steps are also written to the plugin
   **Log** in its configuration dialog.

To turn the feature off, uncheck **Optimize EPUBs before transfer** — books are
then sent exactly as Calibre exports them.

## On-device status

When the device connects, Calibre marks the library books that are already on it
(the "on device" indicator, the same one you see right after sending a book).

No download is needed. On connect the plugin recognizes device files in two fast,
local ways:

1. **Sent-book cache** — when a book is sent, its identity (`uuid`, title,
   authors) is cached locally, so it's recognized instantly on every later
   connect. The cache is updated on send/delete and pruned when files disappear.
2. **Library name match** — a book can only be marked on-device if it's in your
   library, so for anything not in the cache (e.g. side-loaded, or sent from
   another computer) the plugin matches the device **file name against your
   library by title** and attaches that book's `uuid`. When several library books
   share a title, an author in the device path disambiguates; if it's still
   ambiguous, the file is left unmarked rather than mismatched.

Both happen with no network transfer. The optional **Fetch metadata** setting is
a last resort for library books whose on-device filename doesn't resemble the
title at all: it downloads each unmatched EPUB once on connect to read its exact
identity, then caches it. Most setups never need it — leave it off unless some
library books still aren't marked.

Install:
1. Download the latest release ZIP from the [releases page](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/calibre-plugins/releases) (or zip the contents of this directory). Do not open or extract the ZIP; install the ZIP file itself.
2. In Calibre: Preferences > Advanced > Plugins > Load plugin from file.
3. The device should appear in Calibre once it is discoverable on the network.

No configuration needed. The plugin auto-discovers the device via UDP and
falls back to 192.168.4.1:81.
